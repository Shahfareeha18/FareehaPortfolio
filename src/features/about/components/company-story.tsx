            I am a backend-focused web application developer with over 4+ years of
            experience building scalable, secure, and performance-driven systems.
            My core expertise lies in PHP and Laravel, where I design robust
            architectures for real-world business applications.

            I have worked extensively on eCommerce platforms, CRM systems, and
            custom web applications, collaborating with teams to turn complex
            business requirements into reliable solutions. Alongside backend
            development, I work with Next.js, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
            to ensure seamless integration between frontend and backend.
